**cmdX** is a lightweight, console-based tool designed to capture screenshots and upload them based on ShareX `.sxcu` configuration files. I created this tool due to the lack of native support for ShareX on Linux.

## Requires:
- `libcurl`
- `libjsoncpp`

## Usage:
- `./cmdX [config.sxcu] full/areah` â€“ Captures a screenshot in a mode, uploads using the config file.
